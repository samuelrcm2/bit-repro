### Configuring your Generator

Edit your `workspace.jsonc` file and set this component to use the `teambit.harmony/aspect` env under the variants object.

```json
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
  "{plasma-ui}": {
    "teambit.harmony/aspect": {}
  },
}
```

To check if your component is using the correct env you can run `bit envs` or `bit show <my-generator>>`

Edit your `workspace.jsonc` file and add the component id, (scope name / component name) to teambit generator. This should go at root level. The component id can be found in the `aspect.ts` file:

```json
{
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "aspects": ["my-scope/factory/react-component"]
  }
}
```

This registers the component aspect so that your templates will appear in the CLI when you run `bit templates`.

### Modifying your Generator

The `react-component.main.runtime.ts` file contains two templates: the standard one including View and ViewModal file; MVVM one that includes Model file as well.

### Using your Generator

Use your generator to create the component files

```bash
bit create plasma-component <my-component-id>
```

### Exporting your Generator

Tag and export your generator component so you can use it in any other workspace. Make sure the scope name is set correctly in the `aspect.ts` file before tagging and exporting. Once you have tagged and exported the component you can add it to the `workspace.jsonc` file in the workspace where you want to use this generator.

```json
{
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "aspects": ["my-scope-name/my-components"]
  }
}
```

Run `bit templates` to see your generator and then use it to generate you components.
